        <h4>How to Succeed</h4>
        <p>
          Get help from anywhere you can. Find a friend who is already into web
          development, use google as much as necessary, and don't be afraid to
          say "I don't know".
        </p>

        <p>
          Pick a simple website and try to copy it. You can add your own content
          and just copy the design or you can copy it word for word to practice.

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
          write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
          you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
          you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
          exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.
